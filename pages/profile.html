            <p>After Moonton's staff of 20 finished developing its first game called Magic Rush: Heroes, released in 2015 to commercial
                 success, they proceeded with developing the company's next project, a mobile multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA)
                  game later titled Mobile Legends. The staff's experience with engineering Magic Rush: Heroes for a global market,
                   such as customizing its features for the differing cultures and state of telecommunications of various countries,
                    became beneficial for them to effectively design Mobile Legends as an appealing game for global players.[19]
                     Mobile Legends was released by Moonton with the subtitle "5v5 MOBA" on 14 July 2016.[20] The game was distributed
                      by Elex Tech in the United States.[21] However, after the lawsuit from Riot Games in 2017, Moonton has removed the
                       game from Google Play and re-released it as Mobile Legends: Bang Bang
